### Hey!

Im Felix, 20 from Austria ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹ and I study Software Development ðŸ–¥ at 42 Heilbronn ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª
!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my startup ðŸš€
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Flutter ðŸ§¢
- ðŸŽ› This is my .bashrc: 
```
// .bashrc from FelixBrgm
export PS1="\W> "
alias ll="ls -la"
alias ld="echo && ls | cat && echo"
```
- âš¡ Favorite bit of code: 
```
// It's a super short version of get_next_line in C
char *get_next_line(int fd)
{
  char *s = malloc(10000), *c = s;
  while (read(fd, c, 1) > 0 && *c++ != '\n');
  return s > c ? (*c = '\0') : (free(s), NULL);
}
```
